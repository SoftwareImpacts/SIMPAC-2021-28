MinViME - Minimum Viable Model Estimator 
-------------------------------------------

For many business problems it is worthwhile understanding how accurate a
machine learning model would need to be before you try and build it.

This information could be useful in prioritising projects or determing the
quantity and quality of data that will be needed. Extremely accurate models
for complicated problems typically require large amounts of data.

This application is a tool that allows you to estimate
what the minimum performance characteristics would need to be.

The first version will be restricted to binary classification problems only.

It will make the estimate in terms of the ROC plot charcateristics that satisfy the constraints
provided as a cost/benefit payoff matrix, the required ROI and information about the 
volume and frequency of the event you are predicting.
