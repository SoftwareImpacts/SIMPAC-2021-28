Estimate Minimum Required Model Performance
-------------------------------------------

In many cases it is worthwhile understanding how accurate a
machine learning model would need to be before you try and build it.

This information could be useful in prioritising projects or determing the
quantity and quality of data that will be needed. As extremely accurate models
for complicated problems typically require large amounts of data.

This application is a tool that allows you to estimate
what the minimum performance characteristics would need to be.
It does this in terms of the ROC plot charcateristics that satisfy the constraints
provided as a cost/benefit payoff matrix, the required ROI and information about the 
volume and frequency of the event you are predicting.
