Introduction
============

MinViME is a package and application that will help you estimate the baseline
machine learning model performance that will satisfy a set of business criteria.

There are two main ways to use MinViME:

#. GUI. You can launch the MinViME flask application and use a graphical interface to supply the problem specification and view the estimate of the minimum viable model performance.
#. API. You can include the MinViME package inside your own custom python code and use it to estimate performance characteristics programmatically, or run simulations across a range of variations in the problem specification.
