Sanchez argues that the application of a cost/yield matrix to the outcomes of a classifier decision
can be used to define a utility function that can be analysed in game theoretic terms. He confines his
analysis to situations in which the only yields are derived from true positives and true negatives,
and they are equal. The results in a demonstartion that the ideal classifier maximises predictive accuracy
by finding the threhsold of the ROC curve that intersects with the line TPR = 1 - FPR.


Chen et al use numerical simulations to look at the impact of classification thresholds for a range of 
machine learning models applied to a selection of biomedical datasets.
