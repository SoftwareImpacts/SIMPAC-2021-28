%% Text of abstract 
MinViME is a python package and web application that allows developers
to estimate the performance characteristics of a Minimum Viable Machine Learning Model for a specific
problem. It has been used to evaluate the feasibility of machine learning projects
, prioriotize among projects, and run simulations to explore the
structure of the difficulty landscape across multiple dimensions
of business problems.

\section{Introduction}

Machine learning projects are undertaken with an expectation
that they will add value to the process in which they will be used.
The value added depends on both the performance characteristics of the model
and the characteristics of the business application. These dual sets
of constraints mean that for any specific business problem there is an
in principal minimally performant model that provides the minimal required
value.

MinViME is a software application that allows developers and data scientists
to estimate the minimal performance characteristics of a machine learning
model for a specific application. The user enters the specification of the problem
and the costs and benefits of the decision scenario the model will assist with.
This structure follows the cost matrix analysis used in the cost sensitive learning
literature \cite{Domingos1999,Margineantu2000,Elkan2001,Tian+Zhang2019}, and
elsewhere used to adjust the decision threshold of classifier systems \cite{Nikolaou2016}
and estimate the ROI of machine learning solutions \cite{Ylijoki2018}.
 
In our theoretical work we demonstrated that the MinViME system can produce a range of metrics 
from both analytical and numerical techniques \cite{Hawkins2020}. These metrics include: 
minimal \textit{precision}, estimated \textit{AUC} and a novel \textit{simplicity}  
metric which allows for direct comparison between machine learning projects purely 
on the basis of the business criteria.

\section{Architecture}

The MinViME application consists of an underlying API that can be used inside custom
applications and simulations. In addition the package installs a web based graphical
used interface that is deployed as a flask application. The input screen depicted
in Figure \ref{screen1} allows a user to configure the characteristics of the business
problem.

\caption{MinViME Web Application Problem Input Screen}
\label{screen1}
\end{figure}

Upon submission, the system makes the API calls to generate analytical and
numerically simulated estimates of the minimum viable model's performance. The results
are shown in Figure \ref{screen2}.

\section{Impact}

The MinViME package has permitted us to run simulation experiments to answer questions
about the relationship between the landscape of business problems and viable models 
\cite{Hawkins2020}.
These simulations form the basis of a new form of heuristic for managers of data science
and machine learning projects.

Through analysis of the PyPi package datasets (https://packaging.python.org/)
we determined that the MinViME package has been installed 
by $>640$ users since its release 6 month ago. Then monthly downloads remain at $~60$
per month.


\section{Future Work}

We are currently working on extensions of the MinViME API to allow estimation of 
minimal viable models for regression and time series forecasting problems. 
This will lead to subsequent simulation work in exploring the problem difficulty landscape
for these classes of problems. We anticipate that these API's will find additional
utility for engineers building automated machine learning systems that are tasked
with determining whether the cost of training a model is justified by the likelihood
of success.
